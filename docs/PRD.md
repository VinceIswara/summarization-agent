# Summarization Agent Project - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
The **Summarization Agent** is an application that automatically generates concise summary reports from emails forwarded from Outlook. The system leverages the latest OpenAI agentic API primitives—specifically, the **Assistants API** (accessed via the latest SDK) and GPT-4o's multi-modal ingestion—to autonomously process email content and attachments (including PDFs, DOC, Excel, PPT, and images). The agent produces a report composed of bullet points and integrated visuals. Importantly, while the AI Agent's processing is executed in seconds, the final summary is designed to be consumed within a 10‑minute reading timeframe.

Additionally, the project uses:
- **Supabase** for database management, file storage, and authentication.
- **Sendgrid** for email responses/notifications.
- **Twilio** for sending WhatsApp messages with the AI Agent's responses.

## 2. Objectives
- **Automated Analysis:**  
  Build an autonomous agent using the latest OpenAI agentic API primitives to process emails and attachments.
- **Multi-Modal Ingestion:**  
  Support various file types by converting DOC, Excel, and PPT files to PDF, then ingest these PDFs and images directly with GPT-4o.
- **Concise Reporting:**
